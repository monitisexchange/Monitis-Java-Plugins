### Monitis Logs Monitor

This project presents the custom monitor that provide remotely monitoring Java logs based on Monitis Open API 
and by using approach described in <https://github.com/shunanya/Monitis-Java-Plugins>. 

The Java logs monitor works as separate Application to avoiding of  inadmissible affects and side effects onto the monitored application.
Besides, the Java Logs Monitor is fully implemented  on Java to get platform independence like monitored application.
Requirements for monitored application is the following

  - Aplication should use Log4J logging library
  - log_mon.jar have to be included in addition into the list of Aplication libraries
  - Log4J configuration should have XML format
  - The specially tuned SocketAppender has to be added in addition into Log4J configuration like depicted below

<code>
  :	\<appender name="monitisAppender" class="org.apache.log4j.net.SocketAppender"\>  
    :		\<param name="Port" value="4560" /\>  
		\<param name="RemoteHost" value="localhost" /\>  
		\<param name="ReconnectionDelay" value="10000" /\>  
		\<param name="Threshold" value="ALL" /\>  
		\<filter class="org.monitis.logmonitor.logger.MonitisFilter"\>  
   		\<param name="filterPattern" value="(Error|Fatal|Warn*|Attention)" /\>	Pattern-string for selection of log records that you want to monitor  
   		\<param name="minAllowedLevel" value="WARN" /\>  
		\</filter\>  
  :	\</appender\>  
</code>

where

 - "Port" is the port number that listen Log Monitor
 - "RemoteHost" is the host machine IP where the Log Monitor is located
 - "ReconnectionDelay" is the time interval to periodically try to establish connection to the Log Monitor
 - "Threshold" is the log records level that will be given to monitisAppender for analysis
 - "filterPattern" is a pattern-string for selection of log records that you want to monitor
    (default is no any pattern - so all records will be sent to Log Monitor)
 - "minAllowedLevel" is the log records level (ERROR, WARN, DEBUG, etc.) that you want to monitor
    (default value is WARN)

Note that usage of SocketAppender gave us, in addition, a possibility to be wholly free of what other appenders 
uses monitored application because log records will be received directly from Logging system 
but not through a log file or some other secondary  sources.
So, the cooperation of monitored application and log monitor can be depicted as the following rough diagram

<code>

      -------------         -------------
     |             |       |             |
     | Monitored   | ----> | log-monitor | ---> Monitis
     | Application |  TCP  |             | HTTPs
      -------------         -------------  
                   filtered
                  log records

</code>

The project contain the following code 
(the separated lib folder wasn't commited to avoid duplication)

 * log_mon	-		Log Monitor project folder

<code>

    distr
		
      log_mon.jar		Compiled Log Monitor JAR file
      log4j.xml			Configuration for Logging engine
      *.jar			libraries for Log Monitor

</code>

 * properties	
		
<code>

      logmonitor.properties -	Properties file for Log Monitor

</code>

  * src	-			Folder that contain the source codes for Log Monitor

  * log_simulator	-		The monitored application simulator (sample - used for testing purpose only)

<code>

    distr

      logsim.jar		Compiled sample application
      log4j.xml			Typical sample configuration for monitored application
      *.jar			libraries for sample application
    src				Folder that contain the source codes for sample application

</code>

Please notice that we are using in this project the cropped Open API Java library (custom monitor strongly needed functionality have been kept only) 

The Monitored application and Log Monitor can be started in arbitrary sequence because any 
of mentioned applications will do just his own work until there isn't yet connection one 
to other and periodically try to establish the connection.
Please note that before checking of workability of the monitor, replace  the existing values 
in the 'logmonitor.properties' by your own desired values.

Thus, in Linux machine you can run e.g. like the following (or in reverse order)

<code>

    cd /home/log_simulator/bin
    java - jar logsim.jar &

    cd /home/log_mon/distr
    java -jar log_mon.jar &

</code>

We suppose here that projects are located in the 'home' folder.
